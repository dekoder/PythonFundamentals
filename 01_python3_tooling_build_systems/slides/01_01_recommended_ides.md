# Browser IDE's With Python **Strong** Python Support 

In the recent years Browser IDEs have become more prevalent, robust support and language support. Some of our favorites we use here at Obscurity Labs and that have strong features:

* GitPod - Disposable K8s pods that can even be used for the Pull Request Process.
* Cloud9 - AWS service with direct access to EC2.
* Repl - Awesome Python support and mini-public instance (supports multi-play!)
* codeanywhere - Strongest platform that has a free plan, multiplayer, but can be advanced

# GUI IDE's With Python **Strong** Python Support 

The classic tried and true IDE's!

* VisualStudio Code - Great plugin support and great starting place (Has  multiplayer and remote WSL, SSH!).
* Sublime - Great plugin support and great starting place.
* PyCharms - One of the strongest platforms, but very heavy weight and resource hungry.
* codeanywhere - Strongest platform that has a free plan, multiplayer, but can be advanced.

# CLI IDE's With Python **Strong** Python Support 

Better know what your doing :)

* VIM - Great plugin support, but hard to use!
* EMACS - Classic and very powerful IDE but can be hard to use.

# Host setup

For this course we will be using Repl.it. So no host setup will be needed. But on many development instances
it can be as simple as using your package manager of choice. We will be using Repl today for a few main reasons:

* No VM required
* Very to little local resources needed
* Ease of teaching aid
* Multiplayer coding support
* GitHub integration
* In-browser host support
