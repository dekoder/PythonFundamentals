# Using Git

### Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System.

Lets disassemble this into some important chunks. As Git is a important part of programing and could be a 4 hour course on its own.

* Control System - Git is a content tracker.
* Version Control System - Git keeps changing as more code is added (developers can add code in parallel).
* Distributed Version Control System - Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository

# Why is VCS needed?

Many real-world projects have many developers working on a project at once. VCS such as Git is needed to ensure there are no code conflicts.

Allowing you to track the who, what, and when of the development life cycle.

VCS also allows developers to revert back to a known state of `good` in the case catastrophe strikes.
