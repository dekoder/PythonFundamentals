# Numeric Types Overview
There are three distinct numeric types:
* intergers - `1`
* floating point numbers - `1.11111`
* complex numbers - `3e+26J`

**NOTE:** Booleans are a subtype of integers (Eg. `True` or `False`)

For this course, we will be focusing primarily on the basics of `int` and `float` types as your introduced to Python.

# Python 3 Types
Its important to understand C/C++ principles first, to understand what makes Python types so easy to work with. Lets take the following example in C:
```c
/* variable definition: */
int a = 1; 
char b ='G'; 
double c = 3.14; 
```
Now in Python, notice we dont declare it statically?
```python
# variable definition
a = 1 
b ='G'
c = 3.14
```

# Python3 Integers
**Five standard types you need know:**
- Numeric Types - int, float, complex
- Text Sequence Type - str
- Sequence Types - list, tuple, range
- Set Types - set, frozenset
- Mapping Types - dict
- Binary Sequence Types â€” bytes, bytearray, memoryview

# Python Numeric Types
- There are three distinct numeric types: integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers
- Booleans are a subtype of integers
- Integers have unlimited precision
- Floating-point numbers are usually implemented using double in C

# Integer Operations

Here are a few of the `basic` operations you can perform in Python. This is not an exhaustive list as many operations are out of the scope of this course.
| Operation |            Result             |
| --------- | :---------------------------: |
| x + y     |        sum of x and y         |
| x - y     |     difference of x and y     |
| x * y     |      product of x and y       |


---
# Interger Operations Cont.
| Operation |            Result             |
| --------- | :---------------------------: |
| x / y     |      quotient of x and y      |
| int(x)    |    x converted to integer     |
| float(x)  | x converted to floating point |
| pow(x, y) |       x to the power y        |
| x ** y    |       x to the power y        |

# Using Intergers
Using the python interpreter we can perform live math operations:

```Python
Python 3.7.5 (default, Apr 19 2020, 20:18:17) 
[GCC 9.2.1 20191008] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 10 + 10 <-- basic math
20

>>> type(10 + 10) <-- use type() to check the type
<class 'int'>

>>> int(10 + '10') <-- will fail as a string is not a int
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

```

---
# Using Intergers Cont.
Using the python interpreter we can also use the very first function we will learn `print()`. This prints the value of the `sum`:

```Python
Python 3.7.5 (default, Apr 19 2020, 20:18:17) 
[GCC 9.2.1 20191008] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print(10 + 10) <-- basic math notice as its the same 
20
```

---
# Using Floats
Take not the differences between `float` and `int` when we call the `int()` function:

```Python
Python 3.7.5 (default, Apr 19 2020, 20:18:17) 
[GCC 9.2.1 20191008] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 10.5 + 10.5
21.0

>>> type(10.5 + 10.5)
<class 'float'>

>>> int(10.5 + 10.5)
21

>>> float(10.5 + 10.5)
21.0
```

---
# Using Floats and Ints
Take not the order of operations and combination of an `int` and `float`

```Python
Python 3.7.5 (default, Apr 19 2020, 20:18:17) 
[GCC 9.2.1 20191008] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 10 + (10.5 + 10.5)
31.0

>>> type(10 + (10.5 + 10.5))
<class 'float'>

>>> exit()
```

# Lab 1 - Familiarization
**Tasking**
Using the new `python` command perform the following get familiar with `numeric` types:
1. Perform a basic addition operation ex. `10 + 10`
2. Perform a basic `float` operation ex. `10.1 + 10.21`
3. Perform a basic order of operations ex.  `10 + (10.5 + 10.5)`

# Python Numeric Built-in Methods

Many of the `Types` within Python have methods and in your IDE such as VSC will allow you to explore these. 
##### Here is a example of `int.bit_length()`:
```python
>>> n = -37                                                                         
>>> bin(n) 
'-0b100101'
>>> n.bit_length()
6
```
**NOTE:** bin() is the binary representation*
*Here is a example of `int.to_bytes()`:*
```python
>>> (1024).to_bytes(2, byteorder='big')                                                               
b'\x04\x00'
```

# Lab_1.py
## TASKING

Perform the following on the variable `dataNum`:
1) Set Value to `1.2299`
2) Set `dataNumPower` to power of 2 for `dataNum`
3) Set `dataNum2` to the int `10`
4) Set `dataNum2Bytes` to the bytes of `dataNum2`, setting the length to `1` and the byte order to `big`
