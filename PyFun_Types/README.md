# Python 3 Types
Its important to understand C/C++ principles first, to understand what makes Python types so easy to work with. Lets take the following example in C:
```c
/* variable definition: */
int a = 1; 
char b ='G'; 
double c = 3.14; 
```
Now in Python, notice we dont declare it statically?
```python
# variable definition
a = 1 
b ='G'
c = 3.14
```

# Python 3 Types cont.
**Five standard types you need know:**
- Numeric Types - int, float, complex
- Text Sequence Type - str
- Sequence Types - list, tuple, range
- Set Types - set, frozenset
- Mapping Types - dict
- Binary Sequence Types â€” bytes, bytearray, memoryview

# Python Numberic Types
- There are three distinct numeric types: integers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers
- Booleans are a subtype of integers
- Integers have unlimited precision
- Floating point numbers are usually implemented using double in C

# Python Numberic Types Cont.

| Operation |            Result             |
| --------- | :---------------------------: |
| x + y     |        sum of x and y         |
| x - y     |     difference of x and y     |
| x * y     |      product of x and y       |
| x / y     |      quotient of x and y      |
| int(x)    |    x converted to integer     |
| float(x)  | x converted to floating point |
| pow(x, y) |       x to the power y        |
| x ** y    |       x to the power y        |

# Python Numeric Built-in Methods

Many of the `Types` within Python have methods and in your IDE such as VSC will allow you to explore these. 
##### Here is a example of `int.bit_length()`:
```python
>>> n = -37
>>> bin(n) 
'-0b100101'
>>> n.bit_length()
6
```
###### *NOTE: bin() is the binary representation*
##### Here is a example of `int.to_bytes()`:
```python
>>> (1024).to_bytes(2, byteorder='big')
b'\x04\x00'
```

# Lab_1.py
## TASKING

Perfrom the following on the variable `dataNum`:
1) Set Value to `1.2299`
2) Set `dataNumPower` to power of 2 for `dataNum`
3) Set `dataNum2` to the int `10`
4) Set `dataNum2Bytes` to the bytes of `dataNum2`, setting the length to `1` and the byte order to `big`

# Python Text Sequence Type
- Textual data in Python is handled with str objects, or strings
- Strings are immutable sequences of Unicode code points. 
- String literals are written in a variety of ways
-Single quotes: 'allows embedded "double" quotes'
-Double quotes: "allows embedded 'single' quotes".
-Triple quoted: '''Three single quotes''', """Three double quotes"""
- Triple quoted strings may span multiple lines

# Python Text Sequence Operator Cont.
**String `+` Operator** 
```python
>>> a = 'alex' + 'rymdekeo-harvey'
>>> b = 'alex' + ' rymdeko-harvey'
>>> print(a)
alexrymdekeo-harvey
>>> print(b)
alex rymdeko-harvey
```
**String `in` Operator**
```python
>>> 'alex' in 'alex rymdeko-harvey'
True
```
---
# Python Text Sequence Operator Cont.
**String Indexing**
```python
>>> a = 'ALEX'
>>> print(a[1])
L
```
What does this look like in C/C++?
```c
// valid initialization
char name[10] = {'A','L','E', 'X','\0'};     
```
What does this look like in the Python Object?

| A | L | E | X |
| - | - | - | - |
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
