# Mastering Python != Mastering Coding

A couple key things to keep in mind when we talk about building python applications:

1) Understand the right workflows and tools of the “ecosystem” surrounding the core language.
2) Dont spend time writing common building blocks like config file parsers, data validators, and serlizers.
3) Spend the time to truly know the workflow and logic behind programing theory. We call these *patterns*.
4) Donty reinvent the wheel, you are likely to do it wrong or miss critical logic.

# Dont Reinvent the wheel!

A few notes to prevent this `trap` from happening and building confidence in open source code:

* Mange your overconfidence during the planning phase.
* Truly learn pip package management, virtual environments, and requirements files.
* You can build confidence in your package selection through various methods:
    * Test, test, test. If you don't test, your code is broken.
    * Pin your packages by versions!
* Write code at a Higher level of abstraction to focus on the business need not the technical solution.
* If a solution does not exist READ blogs, posts and any ancillary information you can gather on problem set to increase the likelihood of success.
